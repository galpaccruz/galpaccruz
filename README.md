- 👋 Hi, I’m @galpaccruz
- 👀 I’m new to github, cause i mostly work local, so i will be learning how to work here. Im doing my PHD on predictive modeling of Preterm-Children.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... whatever its in my reach. As a biostatician I mostly try to infer info about clinical/biological data. 
PCA methods, clustering, regressions, models, machine learning. But im always working with tiny samples.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything, really. Are you a clinician that needs some stats done? Here I am. Are you someone in a biological field that needs some stats done? Here I am.
- I do like to work with plant data, buts thats just cause I really like botanics.


- 📫 How to reach me ... At galan.bioinformatic@gmail.com
